#Building¹

Building Corona-X requires a bourne-like shell (`bash`, `sh`, etc.), google `repo`, and a working (native) C Compiler.
Note: `repo` can be downloaded with the following command: `curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > repo`²

##Instructions to Check Out the Source Tree:

1. Make a folder to store the source

2. Open a shell and navigate to the folder from step 1 (`cd name`)

4. Execute `repo init -u https://github.com/Corona-X/Corona-X -b branch`³ in the source folder.

5. Execute `repo sync`. This will download the current Corona-X source tree.

##Instructions for Building the Source Tree:


---

1: Corona-X will build on Mac OS X, most Linux Distributions, (probably?) Anything *BSD, and (soon!) itself.<br>
2: See [here](https://code.google.com/p/git-repo/) or [here](http://source.android.com/source/downloading.html) for more information on installing and using repo.<br>
3: Current Branches: `Initial-Development`<br>
